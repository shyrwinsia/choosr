### FIRST RELEASE CANDIDATE

Wohoo! We finally have our first release candidate! ðŸŽ‰

It's relatively stable now but some things may still break. For any bugs found, please contact me.

### FEATURES

- **View Lists** The home page will show a collection of your lists. Tapping an item will go to the pick page. Long press will reveal the context menu.
- **Create/Edit List**
  - **Choose Icon** Choose one of the nine (9) available icons.
  - **Add/Remove Items** Items can be added to or removed from the list.
- **Random Pick** Tapping the screen in the pick page will randomly select from the active items in the list.
- **Toggle Items** Items disabled in the toggle page will not be included in the pick.
- **No Successive Pick** The pick result will automatically be excluded in the next pick. This mechanism prevents one item from successively showing up.

### KNOWN ISSUES

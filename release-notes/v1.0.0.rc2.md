### SECOND RELEASE CANDIDATE

Couple of improvements and polishing. Thanks for all the feedback from the beta testers.

### ENHANCEMENTS

- Add a way for the user to add items or toggle when nothing can be picked [#1](https://github.com/shyrwinsia/dcydr/issues/1).
- Give a shortcut to add items from the pick page [#4](https://github.com/shyrwinsia/dcydr/issues/1).
- Look for another "Toggle" icon instead of the gear [#5](https://github.com/shyrwinsia/dcydr/issues/5).
- Reduced padding of textfield input in Add Item [#8](https://github.com/shyrwinsia/dcydr/issues/8).

### POLISHED USER EXPERIENCE

- Moved UI context menu to manage (edit, delete, toggle) the list from the home page to pick page.
- Custom toggle switch was made to fit the theme instead of the checkmark icon from the previous version.
- Changed error messages to be more descriptive for the user to recover.

### BUGFIXES

- The pick has a possibility of repeating when pick page is closed [#6](https://github.com/shyrwinsia/dcydr/issues/6).

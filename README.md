## Bugs and Issues

This is just a side-project I write during my free time. It's not perfect and I'll do my best to fix legit bugs. If you see something wrong, fork this repo and send me a pull request. I'd love to collaborate.

## Upcoming Features

This app aims to be simple, clean and fast. A picking animation or a 'shake to pick' will never be added as a feature. There are other apps out there that already do that. By contrast, here are some features I'm planning to do in the future:

- Categorize items and lists
- Batch select and deselect
- Reorder lists
- Clone and edit list
- Share list to another user

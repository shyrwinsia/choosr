Can't decide...

- Where to eat?
- Who to throw under the bus?
- Bus or train?
- Left or Right?
- Rock, Paper or Scissors?

Let Dcydr help you!

### No more indecision

Dcydr helps you, a victim of analysis paralysis pick a random choice from a list that you can customize. You may add as many choices as you like for each list and choose icons to match it.

### Fit for every situation

When picking for specific occasions, like maybe its a Sunday and some of your favorite restaurants in the list are closed. You can restrict Dcydr by disabling some choices. No need remove and add them back again.

### Clean and straightforward interface

Unlike other randomizing apps, Dcydr does not have needless fancy animations, cartoonish graphics or complicated interfaces. It decides for you in the simplest and fastest way possible. Just tap the screen.

### Save them brain juices

Decisions, no matter how small, take mental effort. Studies have repeatedly shown that we humans have very limited amounts of it. So don't waste brain power deciding on those small mundane things. Save them for your bigger decisions! For your other trivial decisions, let Dcydr decide for you.

## Get it

To be uploaded to App Store and Google Play soon.

## Disclaimer

I am not liable for any disastrous consequences that may have resulted from the suggestions of the app.

## Bugs and Issues

This is just a side-project I write during my free time. It's not perfect, so don't complain. But still, I'll do my best to fix legit bugs.

## Upcoming Features

This app aims to be simple, clean and fast. A picking animation or a 'shake to pick' will never be added as a feature. There are other apps out there that do that, but this isn't one of them. By contrast, here are some features I'm planning to do in the future:

- Categorize items and lists
- Batch select and deselect
- Reorder lists
- Clone and edit list
- Share list to another user

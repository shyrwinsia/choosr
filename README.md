# Choosr

Can't decide...

- Where to eat?
- Who to throw under the bus?
- Bus or train?
- Left or Right?
- Rock, Paper or Scissors?

Let Choosr help you!

### No more indecision

Choosr helps victims of paralysis analysis by picking a random choice from a list that you customize. You can add as many as you like for every situation and choose icons to match your list.

### Fit for every situation

When picking for specific occasions, you can also restrict Choosr by disabling some choices. No need remove and enter them back again.

### Free yourself

Deciding takes a lot of mental effort. So don't waste those brain power deciding on those small mundane things. Save them for your bigger decisions. For those other trivial things, let Choosr choose for you.
